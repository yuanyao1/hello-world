git practice

Just adding some text to see how this works. Add a new line. Let's see what happens if I add more content. Will this line wrap around if it contains too many characters?

what if it's not a .md file?

Can I **bold** and _italicize_ without .md?

Line concurrently with the pull request

**bold** _italic_
